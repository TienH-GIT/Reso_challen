# Stakeholder Communication Plan: Advanced Analytics Dashboard (AAD)

## Executive Summary
The Advanced Analytics Dashboard (AAD) project is currently three weeks behind schedule due to unforeseen technical challenges. This delay poses a significant business risk, especially as several key enterprise customers are waiting on this critical feature. The primary communication challenge lies in maintaining stakeholder alignment, managing expectations, and preserving trust across both internal leadership and external clients. Key stakeholders include the executive leadership team (CEO, CTO, CPO), product management, engineering leads, customer success teams, and enterprise clients. Each group has unique concerns ranging from timeline delays to revenue impact and product stability. The main objective of this communication plan is to ensure clear, consistent, and timely messaging across all audiences, enabling effective decision-making and risk mitigation while preserving confidence in the delivery roadmap.
