# RISK ASSESSMENT

## Risk Matrix
| Risk                                    | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Service Downtime During Migration    | Medium      | High   | Use blue-green deployments, canary releases, and automated rollbacks      |
| 2. Skill Gaps in Microservices & DevOps | High        | Medium | Provide targeted training, assign senior mentorship, limit EKS complexity |
| 3. Data Loss or Inconsistency           | Low         | High   | Use RDS snapshots, transactional consistency checks, and phased cutover   |

## Detailed Risk Analysis
### Risk 1: Service Downtime During Migration
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: High
- **Description**: A service outage during migration could affect checkouts, leading to revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction.
- **Mitigation**: Use canary deployments for gradual rollout, blue-green deployment to switch traffic, and maintain full legacy fallback path during migration windows.

### Risk 2: Skill Gaps in Microservices & DevOps Tooling
- **Probability**: High
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Description**: The current engineering team may lack deep experience with Docker, ECS/EKS, and distributed service patterns.
- **Mitigation**: Assign microservices experts as leads, conduct internal AWS and container training, and avoid complex Kubernetes adoption unless required.

### Risk 3: Data Loss or Inconsistency During Migration
- **Probability**: Low
- **Impact**: High
- **Description**: Inconsistent data during the transition of cart, checkout, and orders can break transactional flows and user trust.
- **Mitigation**: Use database replication, version-controlled APIs, and shadow traffic testing to ensure data integrity before cutover.


## Contingency Plans
### Plan A:
- Deploy microservices in parallel to the monolith
- Route small % of traffic using feature flags
- Monitor error rates and roll back automatically if thresholds are exceeded

### Plan B:
- Fall back to monolith for affected services
- Delay full migration until issues are resolved
- Use temporary hybrid integration layer for partial microservices routing

### Escalation Procedures:
- When: Triggered by SLA violations (e.g., uptime < 99.5%, 500 errors > 2%)
- How: Notify tech lead, SRE, and project manager immediately via pager duty
- Action: Pause deployment, activate rollback, initiate war room within 30 minutes
