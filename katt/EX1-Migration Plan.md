# MIGRATION PLAN
## Implementation Strategy
TechMart will adopt the Strangler Fig approach, gradually replacing components of the monolithic system with microservices. This allows us to minimize downtime, maintain operational continuity, and reduce migration risk. Legacy components will be phased out once equivalent services are live and stable.

### Phase Breakdown
#### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup & Foundation (Months 1–2)
- Provision ECS/Fargate, RDS, Redis, CloudFront, and CI/CD pipelines
- Configure API Gateway, centralized logging, and CloudWatch monitoring
- Migrate static frontend to S3 + CloudFront

#### Phase 2: Core Service Migration (Months 3–4)
- Migrate Auth, Catalog, Cart, and Checkout into microservices
- Frontend updated to communicate with new APIs via Gateway
- Implement Redis caching and session management

#### Phase 3: Advanced Services & Optimization (Months 5–6)
- Migrate Order Management and Search
- Archive historical data and implement read replicas
- Performance tuning, load testing, and monolith deprecation

### Dependencies
| Phase      | Dependency                                               |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Phase 2    | Redis, API Gateway, and CI/CD pipelines from Phase 1     |
| Phase 3    | Auth and Checkout microservices must be stable           |
| All Phases | Ongoing monitoring and logging must be active from start |

### Rollback Strategy
- **Canary Releases**: Route small % of traffic to new services for validation.
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: ECS environments for safe switchovers.
- **Feature Flags**: Control release toggles within the frontend/backend.
- **Automated Backups**: Nightly snapshots of RDS and infrastructure state.
- **Monolith Fallback**: Legacy system remains operational during migration.

## Timeline
### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup & Basic Services (Months 1–2)
| Deliverables                           | Deadline |
| -------------------------------------- | -------- |
| ECS (Fargate), RDS, Redis, CDN setup   | Week 3   |
| CI/CD Pipelines with Terraform         | Week 4   |
| API Gateway and service routing        | Week 5   |
| S3/CloudFront for frontend             | Week 6   |
| Basic observability (CloudWatch, logs) | Week 8   |

### Phase 2: Core Services Migration (Months 3–4)
| Deliverables                          | Deadline |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Auth & Catalog microservices          | Week 10  |
| Redis-backed Cart microservice        | Week 12  |
| Checkout service with payment gateway | Week 14  |
| Frontend API refactor + integrations  | Week 16  |

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Optimization (Months 5–6)
| Deliverables                         | Deadline |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Order and Search service deployments | Week 20  |
| Data archival and read replicas      | Week 22  |
| Full performance load test           | Week 23  |
| Monolith shutdown & final handoff    | Week 24  |

### Milestones
- M2: Infrastructure + CI/CD fully operational
- M4: Core revenue services (Catalog, Checkout) migrated
- M6: All services microservice-based; monolith decommissioned

### Critical Path
- **ECS and Redis setup**: Required before deploying any microservices
- **Auth service**: Needed before Cart and Checkout
- **Checkout stability**: Critical for Order service and business continuity

## Resource Allocation
### Team Structure
| Role               | Count | Responsibilities                                 |
| ------------------ | ----- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Backend Engineers  | 4     | Microservice dev, DB migration, API integration  |
| Frontend Engineers | 2     | Refactor for new APIs, integrate Gateway routing |
| DevOps Engineers   | 2     | Infra as Code, CI/CD, monitoring, scaling        |

### Skills Required
- Backend: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Redis, REST APIs
- Frontend: React, Axios/Fetch, CDN configuration
- DevOps: Terraform, AWS ECS, RDS, CI/CD pipelines, CloudWatch

| Search Engine   | OpenSearch cluster setup and indexing         |
| CDN & SSL       | CloudFront setup with certs and routing rules |

### Budget Breakdown
| Category               | Allocation | Notes                                |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| AWS Infrastructure     | \$200K     | ECS, RDS, Redis, CloudFront, backups |
| Engineering Labor      | \$200K     | Internal resource cost (6 months)    |
| Monitoring & APM       | \$50K      | Datadog, CloudWatch logs, alerts     |
| Contingency / Overruns | \$50K      | Buffer for risks and 3rd-party tools |
