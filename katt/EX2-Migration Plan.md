# Migration Plan: Advanced Analytics Dashboard (AAD)

## Project Overview

- **Project Name**: Advanced Analytics Dashboard (AAD)
- **Current Status**: 3 weeks behind schedule
- **Target Delivery**: July 29, 2025
- **Project Manager**: Nguyen Thanh Phuong
- **Stakeholders**: CTO, Head of Product, Enterprise Account Managers, Key Enterprise Clients

## Chosen Solution
- **Approach**: Implement a Hybrid Approach—short-term optimizations (query tuning, Redis caching) combined with the development of a dedicated microservice for analytics processing.
- **Rationale**: Balances fast delivery and long-term scalability. Allows immediate performance gains while establishing an architecture that supports growth.
- **Success Criteria**: <2-second average dashboard response time; 100% uptime during rollout; no major regressions; positive customer feedback post-release.
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - _Data sync issues between monolith and microservice_ → Mitigation: Implement idempotent sync layer
  - _Deployment delays due to CI/CD complexity_ → Mitigation: Parallel staging environment
  - _Frontend integration issues_ → Mitigation: Use feature flags and phased rollout


## Implementation Timeline
### Phase 1 (Week 1–2): Foundation and Optimization
- **Key Deliverables**: Redis cache setup; query optimization scripts; benchmark report
- **Resource Requirements**: 2 backend developers, 1 DevOps engineer
- **Success Criteria**: Reduce query time by 50%; Redis integration tested in staging
  
### Phase 2 (Week 3–4): Microservice Development and Integration
- **Key Deliverables**: Analytics microservice (v1); data pipeline integration; API contracts
- **Resource Requirements**: 1 backend developer, 1 DevOps engineer
- **Success Criteria**: Microservice deployed in staging; API response time <500ms

### Phase 3 (Week 5–6): QA, Deployment, and Monitoring
- **Key Deliverables**: Full system testing; monitoring dashboards; production release
- **Resource Requirements**: 1 QA engineer, all developers for bug fixing
- **Success Criteria**: Zero P1 bugs; system stable for 5 consecutive days in production

## Resource Allocation

### Team Structure:
- Project Manager: Nguyen Thanh Phuong
- Senior Backend Engineer: Microservice design & caching
- Backend Engineer: Query tuning & API integration
- DevOps Engineer: CI/CD pipeline, deployment
- QA Engineer: Test automation and validation

### Skills Required:
- Microservices (Node.js, Python)
- PostgreSQL query optimization
- Redis and caching techniques
- CI/CD pipeline automation (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- Monitoring tools (Grafana, Datadog)

### External Dependencies:
- Redis cluster provisioning
- Microservice infrastructure setup on cloud platform
- Buy-in from customer success for phased rollout
  
### Budget Requirements:
- Additional $15,000 for cloud resources and performance testing tools

## Risk Management
### Risk Matrix:
- _Microservice latency issues_: Medium probability, High impact
- _Integration bugs with existing frontend_: High probability, Medium impact
- _Resource availability conflicts_: Medium probability, Medium impact

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Load testing in pre-production with real datasets
- Use of feature flags for progressive rollout
- Weekly syncs with product and engineering to resolve blockers early

### Contingency Plans:
- Roll back to optimized monolith via feature flag toggle
- Maintain duplicate data pipelines during migration
- Extend QA buffer by 1 week if P1 bugs emerge

### Escalation Procedures:
- Daily standups with cross-functional team
- Weekly executive sponsor checkpoint
- Immediate Slack/Email escalation for blockers >24 hours unresolved

## Success Metrics
### Technical KPIs:
- Avg. response time <2 seconds
- 99.9% availability post-deployment
- <1% error rate on dashboard endpoints

### Business KPIs:
- Reduction in support tickets by 30%
- Improved customer satisfaction score (CSAT) by 15%
- Prevention of at-risk customer churn (3 key accounts)

### Project KPIs:
- Delivery within 4–6 week timeline
- Resource burn <10% variance from estimate
- Completion of all milestones without major blockers

### Monitoring Plan:
- Real-time dashboards via Datadog/Grafana
- Daily performance checks via synthetic monitoring
- Weekly KPI reporting to stakeholders
